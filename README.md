This repository holds the data and questionnaires for all releases of the Scottish Opinion Monitor (SCOOP), a series of cross-sectional surveys of voting-age adults resident in Scotland conducted by the Scottish Election Study and administered by YouGov. 

Each .zip file contains the SCOOP survey from the specified month/year in .dta format and the relevant questionnaire as a .pdf. The tracker datafile contains "core" measures from all Scoop surveys to date.

The Scottish Election Study is currently carried out as a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, University of Essex, Cardiff University and Royal Holloway, University of London. Professor Ailsa Henderson serves as Principal Investigator, with Professors Rob Johns, Christopher Carman, and Christopher Hanretty serving as Co-Investigators. Dr Fraser McMillan and Dr Jac Larner serve as Research Associates. The wider 2021-2025 Scottish Election Study project, including all survey data collection, is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.
